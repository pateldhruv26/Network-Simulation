# Network-Simulation

This project simulates a network of PCs using a **min-heap priority queue** for efficient pathfinding. It allows users to:

- **Add and Remove PCs from the Network**
- **Establish and Remove links between two PCs of the Network**
- **Visualize the entire network in form of graph.**
- **Calculate and visualize shortest paths between PCs.**
